The project aims to develop a spam mail detector using a machine learning model. With the increasing amount of unsolicited spam emails, an automated system to classify and filter such emails has become crucial. The proposed solution leverages machine learning techniques to accurately identify and categorize emails as either spam or non-spam (ham).

The project begins by collecting a large dataset of labeled emails, consisting of both spam and ham examples. The dataset is then preprocessed to extract relevant features from the email content, such as the presence of certain keywords, email header information, and email body characteristics.

Next, a machine learning model is trained on the preprocessed dataset. Various machine learning algorithms, such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Random Forest, can be employed to build the classifier. The model is trained to learn the patterns and characteristics that differentiate spam emails from legitimate ones.

During the training process, the dataset is split into training and validation sets. The model's performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation techniques may also be employed to ensure the model's generalization ability.

Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to classify new, unseen emails. Incoming emails are passed through the trained model, which predicts their likelihood of being spam. Based on the model's prediction, the emails can be directed to the appropriate folder or subjected to further analysis by the user.

To enhance the system's performance, various techniques can be employed, such as feature selection, dimensionality reduction, or ensemble methods. Additionally, the model can be periodically retrained using new labeled data to adapt to evolving spam email patterns.
